#!/usr/bin/env bash
# pvr-inox-radar installer - copies the skill into your agent's skills directory.
#
# PREFERRED: clone the repo, read it, then run it from the checkout. The
# script installs the bytes you just reviewed and never touches the network:
#
#   ./install.sh            # Claude Code
#   ./install.sh codex      # OpenAI Codex CLI
#   ./install.sh gemini     # Gemini CLI
#   ./install.sh all        # all of the above
#
# Scope: global (into $HOME) by default. Or install PROJECT-LOCAL so the
# skill exists only in that one project:
#
#   cd ~/movie-nights && /path/to/pvr-inox-radar/install.sh --here
#   ./install.sh --project ~/movie-nights all
#
# Run outside a checkout, it clones $REPO - which every copy points at ITSELF,
# so an unattended run can never silently pull code nobody reviewed. Override:
#
#   PVR_INOX_RADAR_REF=<sha|tag|branch> ./install.sh   # pin an exact reviewed commit
#   PVR_INOX_RADAR_NO_FETCH=1 ./install.sh             # refuse to fetch at all
#   PVR_INOX_RADAR_REPO=<url> ./install.sh             # pull from a different repo
#
# Claude Code users can skip this entirely (name whichever repo you trust):
#   /plugin marketplace add karanb192/pvr-inox-radar
#   /plugin install pvr-inox-radar@pvr-inox-radar
#
# macOS and Linux. Windows: use WSL, or copy skills/pvr-inox-radar into
# %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills manually.

# --- Repo identity: the one line that differs between any two copies -------
# Everything else here is generic - it works unchanged in a fork AND in the
# original, because "the repo this script lives in" is the only thing that
# distinguishes them. DEFAULT_REPO must name THAT repo: an installer that
# defaults to a repo its operator does not control re-introduces exactly the
# trust-on-every-install problem the review-first workflow exists to remove.
# To pull from anywhere else, name it explicitly - e.g. the original project:
#   PVR_INOX_RADAR_REPO=https://github.com/karanb192/pvr-inox-radar.git ./install.sh
DEFAULT_REPO="https://github.com/karanb192/pvr-inox-radar.git"   # point this at YOUR repo
